You should output $T$ lines, the $i$-th line donates the answer of:
$$
\int_{l_i}^{r_i}\frac{1}{(x^2+1)^3}\mathrm{d}x
$$

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute error or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. Namely, if your answer is $a$ and the jury's answer is $b$, then your answer is accepted if $\frac{|a-b|}{\max(1, |b|)}\le 10^{-4}$.
