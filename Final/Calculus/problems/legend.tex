Qingyang is very confident in her mathematics and excels in calculus, particularly in integration. She currently has a function:
$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{(x^2+1)^3}
$$

She wants to get integrate $f(x)$. Of course, she easily solved this problem, but she wants to test you. To facilitate the verification of the answers, Qingyang tells you $l_i$ and $r_i$ each time, and you need to tell her:
$$
\int_{l_i}^{r_i}f(x) \mathrm{d}x
$$
